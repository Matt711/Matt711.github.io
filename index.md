I am currently a junior at North Carolina State University majoring in Applied
Mathematics and Electrical Engineering. I am interested in a variety of fields
including quantitative finance, software engineering, and data science. I also contribute
to open-source projects in Python's data science stack; particularly [Dask](https://dask.org/).

A record of my personal projects and contributions to open source is available on GitHub:
